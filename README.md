### 🔒 Access to Private Projects (For Employers)

Most repositories remain private because they include sensitive or identifying information. If you’re interested in reviewing more of my project history, please reach out and I’ll gladly provide access (you can contact me via the information on my resume/application).

I’m also currently building a personal website where more of my projects will be accessible in the near future.
